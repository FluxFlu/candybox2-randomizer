# candybox2-randomizer
A randomizer for the video game Candy Box 2.

To run this program, clone the [Candy Box 2 repository](https://github.com/candybox2/candybox2.github.io). Then, put the `randomizer.js` file into the candybox2 directory. Then, run `randomizer.js`. You must have node.js installed to do so.

In particular, this program randomizes grid items. It asks if you would like to randomize grid items upon being run; this is because there may be more functionality added in the future.
